In this folder, all SVG items are stored.
This is to minimize the size of the graphics for the page, and make it so that the indivudal SVG components can be edited.

original no edits mean that the svg file has not been touched since download (from undraw.co)
edited with figma means that I have done some edits to the SVG in order to make it fit the content of the page (figma is an open source design tool)

Cheers
